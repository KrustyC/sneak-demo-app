            This is a demo and a template repo to be used for future React apps
            that may need to interact with a Smart Contract on the Ethereum
            Blockhain. The collection you are looking at is fake (as you can see
            from the image), and this only work with the goerli testnet. In
            order to test this out, please make sure you have a Metamask wallet
            and that it is connected to the Goerli testnet. If you need some
            "credit", you can use{" "}

              this faucet

            to send yourself some GoerliETH to test this out.
